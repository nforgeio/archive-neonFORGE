# neon-cli: 18.08-alpha.0

## Changes

This is a major development release including major BREAKING changes to all librares as well as **neon-cli** and hive services.  You will need to redeploy all hives.

The list below includes the highlights:

* Rebranded **neonCLUSTER** to **neonHIVE**
* **neon-cli** no longer shims to Docker by default
* 
* Lots of bug fixes

## Upgrade Steps

You'll need to perform the following steps to upgrade successfully:

1. Remove any Hyper-V virtual switches name **neonCLUSTER**.

2. Rename local Windows Users folders from:

    from: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\neonFORGE\neoncluster
    to:   C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\neonFORGE\hive

3. Redeploy all clusters.

4. Renamed the **C:\cluster-logs** folder to **C:\hive-logs**.  Setup scripts write logs to this new folder.
