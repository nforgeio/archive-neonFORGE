# Release: 18.9.1-preview.0

## Components

* **neon-cli:** `18.9.1-preview.0`
* **neon lib:** *unchanged*

## Overview

This is a point bug fix release.  The main issue is that the (renamed) `neon_hive_dns` Ansible module is not working due to a script file not being renamed too.

## Upgrade

1. Run this command to update each hive: `neon hive update`

## Changes

* Fixed Ansible `neon_hive_dns` module unit tests by fixing a misnamed script file.
* Fixed `JsonClient` unit tests.
* **neon-cli:** Can now retrieve the hive software version via: `neon hive get version`
