# Creates an Ubuntu 16.04 image with all current package updates along with some
# additional handy utility packages.
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#
#   ORGANIZATION    - The Docker Hub organization
#   VERSION         - The version of the .NET runtime to install (e.g. "2.1")
#
# NOTE:
#
# It appears that that latest point release will be installed when you specify
# only the major and minor version (e.g. spcifying "2.1" will actually install
# "2.1.5" if that's the latest point release).  This means you only need to
# rebuild the image to pick up the latest point release.
