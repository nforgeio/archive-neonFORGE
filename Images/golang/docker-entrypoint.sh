# usage: docker-entrypoint PROJECT COMMAND...
#
# Changes the current directory to [/src/PROJECT] before executing COMMAND.
# 
# Build Outputs
# -------------
# The [go build] command generates an executable named PROJECT within the 
# PROJECT directory.  This is inconvenient when using source control because
# we don't want to check in build outputs.  This script works around this.
# 
# If COMMAND completes with [exitcode=0] and a [src/PROJECT/PROJECT] file
# exists afterwards, then this file will be moved to the [bin] subdirectory
# (creating the directory if necessary).  This works well for environments
# where [bin] folders have been added to [.gitignore].
