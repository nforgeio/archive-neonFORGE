    #       error       Service has encountered an error.
    #       warn        Indicates that an error may occur if actions are not taken.
    #       notice      Something unusual has occurred but is not an error.
    #       info        Normal operational messages that require no action.

    #         log level code.

    #
    #               /^\s*\[\s*(.*)\s*\]\s*/
    #
    #         where the matched group is a known log level string, then the
    #         level string will be mapped to one of the standard levels.  Note
    #         that the entire pattern will be stripped from the [message] field.
    #
    #       * [level] will be set to [other] if the level couldn't be determined.
