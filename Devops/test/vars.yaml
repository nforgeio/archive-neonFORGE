# Global deployment variables.

vars:

  # Most routers don't allow packets to loop back from the
  # internal network, to the router's public IP address and
  # then back into the internal network for better security.
  #
  # So, we need to register two DNS names, one that references
  # public IP address and the other that references an internal
  # address.

  # $todo(jeff.lill):
  #
  # In the future, we'd use dynamic DNS to return the external
  # or internal address depending on where the request originated.
