Build Debian Package
--------------------
The Debian package is built automatically in the project post-build
event using the [package-deb\package.ps1] script.  Note that you
need to update [version.go] to be the Debian package version (without
the "-REVISION" suffix).

The package will be created in the [/bin] folder and also copied
to the solution's Build folder.  You'll need to manually upload
the package to the public download site.

Rebuild Dependencies
--------------------

This project uses the GO [dep] tool to manage reference vendor packages.
Ocassionally, you may need to update these packages.  This can be accomplished
via the following commands:

# Start the GOLANG container, mounting the project directory:

docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash -v %NF_ROOT%\Tools:/src nhive/golang

# Run these commands inside the container.

cd /src/neon-volume
dep init
exit
