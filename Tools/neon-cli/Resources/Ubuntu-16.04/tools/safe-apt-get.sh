# Wraps the [apt-get] command such that the command is retried a few times 
# with a delay due to apparent network failures.  [apt-get] actually returns 
# [exitcode=0] when this happens but does report the problem as a warning 
# to STDOUT.  We'll look for this warning and act appropriately.
#
# USAGE: safe-apt-get ARGS
#
# where ARGS is the same as for [apt-get].

# Implementation Notes:
# ---------------------
# We're going to rety the operations a few times when a fetch error is reported,
# waiting a randomish number of seconds between a min/max.  We're going to use 
# the [shuf] command to generate this random number.
#
# We're also going to use a couple of fixed name temporary files to hold the
# output streams.  This means that multiple instances of this command won't
# be able to run in parallel (which probably won't work anyway).
