# $todo(jeff.lill):
#
# I need to research whether I need to do additional Linux tuning of the RAID
# chunk size and other SSD related file system parameters.  The article below
# describes some of this.  It's from 2009 though so it may be out of date.
# Hopefully modern Linux distributions automatically tune for SSDs.

    # This script works by generating the [${NEON_BIN_FOLDER}/neon-tune-ssd] script so that it
    # configures up to 2 boot and 8 data [sd?] devices to:
    #
    #       * Use the [deadline] scheduler
    #       * Indicate that the device does not rotate
    #       * Sets the read-ahead value
    #
    # Then the script configures a systemd service unit file that calls the script
    # during system boot.  Here's the official Debian SSD optimization suggestions:
