# This script handles the configuration of a near-virgin Ubuntu 14.04 server 
# install into one suitable for deploying a cluster cluster to.  This
# script requires that:
#
#       * OpenSSH was installed
#       * Hostname was left as the default: "ubuntu"
#       * [sudo] be configured to not request passwords

# Configure Bash strict mode so that the entire script will fail if 
# any of the commands fail.

#
# NOTE: I'm not using [-u] here to avoid failing for undefined
#       environment variables because some won't be initialized
#       when prepping nodes without a full cluster definition.

# Disable the [apt-daily] service.  We're doing this for two reasons:
#
#   1. This service interferes with with [apt-get] usage during
#      cluster setup and is also likely to interfere with end-user
#      configuration activities as well.
#
#   2. Automatic updates for production and even test clusters is
#      just not a great idea.  You just don't want a random update
#      applied in the middle of the night that might cause trouble.

# We need to modify how [getaddressinfo] handles DNS lookups 
# so that IPv4 lookups are preferred over IPv6.  Ubuntu prefers
# IPv6 lookups by default.  This can cause performance problems 
# because in most situations right now, the server would be doing
# 2 DNS queries, one for AAAA (IPv6) which will nearly always 
# fail (at least until IPv6 is more prevalent) and then querying
# for the for A (IPv4) record.
#
# This can also cause issues when the server is behind a NAT.
# I ran into a situation where [apt-get update] started failing
# because one of the archives had an IPv6 address in addition to
# an IPv4.  Here's a note about this issue:
#
#       http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2282646
#
# We're going to uncomment the line below in [gai.conf] and
# change it to the following line to prefer IPv4.
#
#       #precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10
#       precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  100
#
# Note that this does not completely prevent the resolver from
# returning IPv6 addresses.  You'll need to prevent this on an
# application by application basis, like using the [curl -4] option.

# [sudo] doesn't allow the subprocess it creates to inherit the environment

# As a convienence, we're going to create an [sbash] script, that uses
# [sudo] to start Bash while inheriting the current environment.

# I've seen some situations after a reboot where the machine complains about
# running out of entropy.  Apparently, modern CPUs have an instruction that
# returns cryptographically random data, but these CPUs weren't available
# until 2015 so our old HP SL 365 G10 XenServer machines won't support this.
#
# An reasonable alternative is [haveged]:

#       https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Haveged
#       https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-additional-entropy-for-cloud-servers-using-haveged
#
# This article warns about using this though:
#
#       https://lwn.net/Articles/525459/
#
# The basic problem is that headless servers generally have very poor entropy
# sources because there's no mouse, keyboard, or active video card.  Outside
# of the new CPU instruction, the only sources are the HDD and network drivers.
# [haveged] works by timing running code at very high resolution and hoping for
# execution time variations.  This looksa like it'll be better than nothing.
