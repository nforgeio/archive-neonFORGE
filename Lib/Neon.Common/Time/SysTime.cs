// $todo(jeff.lill):
//
// This class uses [Environment.TickCount] to measure time from system boot.
// There are two problems with this:
//
//      1. TickCount appears to have a resolution of only 500ms.  This
//         will be problematic for applications that need a finer resolution.
//
//      2. TickCount returns the milliseconds from boot as an unsigned 32-bit
//         integer.  This means the value will wrap-around after 49.7 days.
//         The class detects this wrap-around but this isn't super clean.
//
//         For Windows, we could PInvoke to get the GetTickCount64() method.
//         We'd need to figure out an alternative for Linux.
