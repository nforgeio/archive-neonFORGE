alias: $(nodeName)

# The DataStax Enterprise node or nodes responsible for storing OpsCenter data. By default this 
# will be the local node, but may be configured to store data on a separate cluster. The hosts 
# option accepts an array of strings specifying the IP addresses of the node or nodes. 
#
# For example, ["1.2.3.4"] or ["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]
hosts: [$(quotedSeedIPs)]

# Reachable IP address of the opscenterd machine. The connection made will be on stomp_port
stomp_interface: $(opsCenterIP)

# The stomp_port used by opscenterd. The default setting is 61620.
# stomp_port: 61620

# The IP used to identify the node. If broadcast_address is set in cassandra.yaml, this should
# be the same as that; otherwise, it is typically the same as listen_address in cassandra.yaml. 
# A good check is to confirm that this address is the same as the address that nodetool ring outputs.
